### My toxic relationship with R Studio

Hi, I am a student (not anymore very soon) who has been struggling with R Studio. Loving it and hating it (sometimes).

### What do I usually do with R Studio?

I use statistical analysis like t-tests, ANOVAs, and linear regressions often. I love to make graphs inside R Studio. Therefore I think it would be a great idea to post my journey here, mostly so that I won't have to go to my past files and copy my codes whenever I want to do a new analysis.

Sometimes I use R Studio to do funny stuff, like drawing national flags, just for fun. So you will probably see those here.

Feel free to leave comments or suggestions, I am still a junior in the fascinating world of R, and am open to learn new things!

Best, *cocoyamo*
