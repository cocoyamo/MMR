# RStudio Tutorial

## Learning practical uses of RStudio to maximize your data analysis efficiency!

I have a love-hate relationship with RStudio. On one hand, it gives me so much flexibility and support when doing data analysis. On the other hand, I didn't enjoyo it at first, as I often encountered obstacles. 
This page is dedicated to helping you (and me) better grasp RStudio and its powerful magic.

Best,
